## Instructions
<p>To compile the mandatory part, simply go into the cloned repository and use the <code>make</code> command. Then, you can execute the program with this <code>./so_long maps/</code> and add the map you want to try after the '/'. I suggest using the laby.ber map or creating your own!</p>
<p>As for the bonus part, you can write <code>make bonus</code> into the terminal to compile and then execute with <code>./so_long_bonus maps/bonus_maps/</code>. Note that you will need a map that contains an enemy, or you will get an error message.</p>
