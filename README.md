## Disclaimer for 42 students
This project was not made public so that you could copy/paste it and claim it as your own! Just remember that the projects are made so that you can learn new concepts on your own, I am happy to share this project so it might give you ideas/guidance but you will not gain anything from copying. 

## Instructions
### Compilation
To compile the mandatory part, simply go into the cloned repository and use the <code>make</code> command. Then, you can execute the program like this: <code>./so_long maps/</code> and add the map you want to try after the '/'. I suggest using the laby.ber map or creating your own, but first go check out the [map requirements](#map-requirements)!

Example:
```
./so_long maps/laby.ber
```
As for the bonus part, you can write <code>make bonus</code> into the terminal to compile and then execute as showed below. Note that you will need a map that contains an enemy, or you will get an error message.

Example:
```
./so_long_bonus maps/bonus_maps/bonus_emptier.ber
```

### How to play
<p>The goal of this game is to collect all the collectibles, which are carrots in our case. Once you've collected all the carrots, you need to go and find your bunny friend to share the loot.</p>
<p>In the bonus part, there is a fox looking out for you though. Watch out!</p>

### Minilibx
This project had to be done using a simple graphic library called the MLX, which was provided with the subject. I have included the [library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) here with my code but you can find more info on here: [https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx).

### Map requirements
* The map can only be composed of these characters:

| Description | Character|
|--|--|
| Empty space | `0` |
| Wall | `1` |
| Player | `P` |
| Exit | `E` |
| Collectible | `C` |
| Enemy | `F` |

* The map must be rectangular and surrounded by walls.
* The map has to be a .ber file. Not a folder. A file!
* The map must contain exactly one player and one exit, and at least one collectible. For the bonus map, you will also need an enemy.
* There has to be a valid path in the map. If the exit or one of the collectibles is blocked by walls, the map is invalid. The player cannot go through walls!

## Bonus

<p><b>DON'T WORRY! NO BUNNIES WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS GAME!</b></p>
</div>

For the bonus part, it was up to our imagination to add some features. Here were some of the suggested additions:

* Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
* Add some sprite animation.
* Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.

I also decided to create a GAME OVER screen as well as making it possible to restart the game.

Shout out to DALL-E for the fox sprites!

## What I learned
### Problems I faced
* **Animations**: It was quite challenging to get the fox to move in random directions with a speed that made sense. It was mostly alot of trial and error, and in the end I managed to get a respectable result but it is still not as I hoped it would. I might make some changes someday if I have the time, but for now I need to concentrate my efforts on my other projects! :)
* **Infinite loop**: I ran into some trouble when it came the time to stop the enemy loop. I use the mlx_loop_hook function from the MLX and I could not for the life of me stop the loop after the game was over. Then out of nowhere it hit me: I just needed to define a game status, which could be set to default, OVER or WIN and the loop function would check if the status is set to default and stop if it is not the case.
