## Instructions
### Compilation
To compile the mandatory part, simply go into the cloned repository and use the <code>make</code> command. Then, you can execute the program like this: <code>./so_long maps/</code> and add the map you want to try after the '/'. I suggest using the laby.ber map or creating your own, but do not forget the [map requirements](#map-requirements)!

Example:
```
./so_long maps/laby.ber
```
As for the bonus part, you can write <code>make bonus</code> into the terminal to compile and then execute as showed below. Note that you will need a map that contains an enemy, or you will get an error message.

Example:
```
./so_long_bonus maps/bonus_maps/bonus_emptier.ber
```

### How to play
<p>The goal of this game is to collect all the collectibles, which are carrots in our case. Once you've collected all the carrots, you need to go and find your bunny friend to share the loot.</p>
<p>In the bonus part, there is a fox looking out for you though. Watch out!</p>

#### Controls
<p>You can either use <code>WASD</code> to move your character or you can use the arrows. You can move only one tile at a time.</p>
